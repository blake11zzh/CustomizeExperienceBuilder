The variables object is then applied to the style modules (including the custom ones from <code>style.ts</code>) to dynamically generate CSS style sheets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"override-theme-variables\" class=\"group relative s:flex s:flex-nowrap\">Override theme variables<a href=\"#override-theme-variables\" aria-label=\"override theme variables permalink\" class=\"anchor-link\"><calcite-icon scale=\"s\" icon=\"link\"></calcite-icon></a></h3>\n<p>The <code>variables.json</code> file in the sample theme folder contains all variables from the default theme, which can be overridden with different values.</p>\n<p>A simple example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs not-afd-flow-content language-json\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"colors\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"primary\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"red\"</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"typography\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"fontFamilyBase\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Impact, Arial\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"fontSizeBase\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"1rem\"</span>\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: In order to have your theme customization to be reflected correct, please remove any unchanged variables from the demo <code>variables.json</code> file to avoid unneeded theme overrides.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"style-modules\" class=\"group relative s:flex s:flex-nowrap\">Style Modules<a href=\"#style-modules\" aria-label=\"style modules permalink\" class=\"anchor-link\"><calcite-icon scale=\"s\" icon=\"link\"></calcite-icon></a></h3>\n<p>Any custom CSS styles can be added inside of the <code>style.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>Global styles can be added to the <code>globalStyles</code> function and exported as a module with the name of \"Global\".</p>\n<p>Styles for UI components can be added the same way: wrap the CSS in a function and export it as a module with the same name as the component. For example, the <code>buttonStyles</code> function is exported as \"Button\" in the sample <code>style.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>Uncomment the code inside of <code>style.ts</code> to see examples.</p>\n<h3 id=\"localization\" class=\"group relative s:flex s:flex-nowrap\">Localization<a href=\"#localization\" aria-label=\"localization permalink\" class=\"anchor-link\"><calcite-icon

setting panel in the builder to display the name of the theme.</p>\n<p>Register supported locales in the <code>manifest.json</code> as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs not-afd-flow-content language-json\">  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"translatedLocales\"</span>: [\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"en\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"ar\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"zh-cn\"</span>\n  ]</code></pre>\n<p>Each locale needs to have a supporting translation file added under the <code>/translations</code> directory named as <code>{locale}.js</code>, except for \"en\", which has its file named <code>default.ts</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, the \"ar\" locale should have an <code>ar.js</code> file in the <code>/translations</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Then add and edit the text in each locale file, such as the <code>_themeLabel</code> string mentioned above.</p>","tocData":{"items":[{"url":"#sample-theme","title":"Sample theme","items":[{"url":"#how-to-use-the-sample","title":"How to use the sample"},{"url":"#how-it-works","title":"How it
