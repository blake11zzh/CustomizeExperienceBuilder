Jimu-ui is the primary component library for the developer edition of ArcGIS Experience Builder, and you may want to use that first because it will keep your custom widgets and themes consistent with the rest of the Experience Builder theme. If you do have a requirement to use Calcite components, this example will help you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-the-sample\" class=\"group relative s:flex s:flex-nowrap\">How to use the sample<a href=\"#how-to-use-the-sample\" aria-label=\"how to use the sample permalink\" class=\"anchor-link\"><calcite-icon scale=\"s\" icon=\"link\"></calcite-icon></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Clone the <a href=\"https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources\">sample repo</a> and copy this widget's folder (within <code>widgets</code>) to the <code>client/your-extensions/widgets</code> folder of your Experience Builder installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\" class=\"group relative s:flex s:flex-nowrap\">How it works<a href=\"#how-it-works\" aria-label=\"how it works permalink\" class=\"anchor-link\"><calcite-icon scale=\"s\" icon=\"link\"></calcite-icon></a></h2>\n<p>Starting at version 1.8, developer edition of Experience Builder includes a Calcite components entry (<code>calcite-components</code>) from which you can import Calcite components into your custom widget. Importing components from this instance of <code>calcite-components</code> can avoid conflicts and reduce widget size.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs not-afd-flow-content language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { CalciteButton } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'calcite-components'</span>\n\n...\n\n<span
