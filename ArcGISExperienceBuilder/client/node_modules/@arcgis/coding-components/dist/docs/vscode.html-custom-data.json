      "description": "[**Arcade**](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) is a portable, and lightweight expression language used to create custom content throughout the [ArcGIS system](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/index).\nLike other expression languages, it can perform mathematical calculations, format text, and evaluate logical statements.\nIt also supports multi-statement expressions, variables, and flow control statements. Arcade is unique when compared to other expression and scripting languages due to its inclusion of [feature](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/types/#feature) and [geometry](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/guide/types/#geometry) data types.\n\nMap Viewer (MV) was the first ArcGIS Online product to incorporate the new Arcade editor after [the editor's introduction in the November 2022 ArcGIS Online release](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/introducing-the-new-arcade-editor-in-arcgis-online/).\nThis was possible thanks to the Arcade editor component, which enabled MV to implement its own Arcade expression builder.\nYou can now also find the editor in ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Field Maps, and ArcGIS Velocity.\n\nYou can easily get your own dedicated Arcade expression builder with the **Arcade editor** component, which includes:\n\n- An easy to use [layout](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/discover-the-arcade-editors-powerful-new-features/#the-new-layout)\n- An optional minimal layout if you, for example, decide to manually exclude things such as test data, padding, line numbers, and the sidebar\n- A way to execute Arcade expressions in a configurable code editor\n- [Suggestions and code completion](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/discover-the-arcade-editors-powerful-new-features/#suggestions-and-code-completion)\n- [WCAG 2.0 compliant code colorization / syntax highlighting](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/accessibility-and-arcade-working-in-color/)\n- Built-in [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/discover-the-arcade-editors-powerful-new-features/#keyboard-shortcuts)\n- In-editor help for finding information about profile variables relevant to your profile, documentation for constants and functions, a link to the official Arcade documentation, and, in some case, suggestions.\n- Support for many [languages and directionality](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/localization/)\n--\n\n### Events\n- **arcgisDiagnosticsChange** - Emitted when the diagnostics collection has changed.\n- **arcgisScriptChange** - Emitted when the script string has changed.\n\n### Methods\n- `componentOnReady(): Promise<void>` - Create a promise that resolves once component is fully loaded.\n- `getScript(): Promise<string | undefined>` - **Deprecated**: Use `script` property instead.. \n- `getTestResult(): Promise<ArcadeResult>` - Returns the Arcade result for the script for the provided test data.\n- `setFocus(): Promise<void>` - Set the focus on the element.",
