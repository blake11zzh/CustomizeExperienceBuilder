# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript - React wrapper for Map Components

> Note: `@arcgis/map-components-react` was developed for use in React 18. Consider updating to React 19 where the React wrapper is no longer necessary. Check out the [documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-react/) to get started with `@arcgis/map-components` in React 19.

The ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript provides a suite of ready-to-use UI components that simplify the process of creating GIS web applications. This package contains a map component, scene component, and many other components with functionality made possible through the SDK's core API which is also accessible through the components.

## Quick start guide

- Get started by using the [react 18 sample](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-react/#download-project).
- Install the required packages: `@arcgis/map-components-react`, `@arcgis/core`, `@esri/calcite-components-react`.
- Import the necessary CSS files in your project and ensure CSS is configured for the map components:

```js
@import 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.31/@arcgis/core/assets/esri/themes/dark/main.css';
@import url("https://js.arcgis.com/calcite-components/2.3.2/calcite.css");

#root,
html,
body {
  margin: 0;
}

arcgis-map {
  display: block;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

- Add map component: In your main file (e.g., index.tsx), add the `ArcgisMap` component and configure it with an optional `item-id` if using a WebMap from ArcGIS Online or an ArcGIS Enterprise portal:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "@arcgis/map-components/components/arcgis-map";
import "@arcgis/map-components/components/arcgis-zoom";
import { ArcgisMap, ArcgisZoom } from "@arcgis/map-components-react";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ArcgisMap itemId="your-webmap-item-id"></ArcgisMap>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

- Add additional functionality: To your map, you could set properties and use events like `onArcgisViewReadyChange` to detect when the map view is ready, and implement custom JavaScript logic using the core API. For example, you can add the `ArcgisZoom` component and listen for view changes:

```js
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ArcgisMap
      itemId="your-webmap-item-id"
      onArcgisViewReadyChange={(event: CustomEvent) => {
        console.log("MapView ready", event);
      }}
    >
      <ArcgisZoom position="top-left"></ArcgisZoom>
    </ArcgisMap>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
