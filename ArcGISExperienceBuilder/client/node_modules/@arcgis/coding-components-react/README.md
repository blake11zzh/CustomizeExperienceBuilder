# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript - React wrapper for Coding Components

> Note: `@arcgis/coding-components-react` was developed for use in React 18. Consider updating to React 19 where the React wrapper is no longer necessary. Check out the [documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-react/) to get started with `@arcgis/coding-components` in React 19.

The ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript provides a suite of ready-to-use UI components that simplify the process of creating GIS web applications. Currently, this package only includes an [Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) expression code editor.
